I have used java as a language for Selenium.
I initially, created an object for the ChromeDriver for invoking the chrome browser
As i already have .exe file for chrome browser, checked the version and compatability and successfully injected into the program.
Once the object and Browser file has been done, i tried to get the JustEat website and done successfully.
Now, I dont want selenium to execute the cases fastly, so i put down the timer for 5sec
the next step has to input the postal code in the text box and giving a search.
once the website landed inn, i tried to search by cuisine called chinese. 
for fine filteration i tried to check the 'open now' option.
further, i even tried to filter with 'delivery free' option.
i even tried to navigate back, but it didnt work.
i even tried lot many scenarios and cases.
