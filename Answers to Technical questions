once i saw the scenario, it hardly takes a minute to execute it. did it succesfully in 2 minutues. and i actually assigned myself a time of 5 minutes, when i am done with my first task , i tired to implement more cases in the next 3 minutes. i did three more cases in those remaining 3 minutes.If i had more time, i wanted to check the billing procedure by adding items into the cart because, all the radio buttons over there has same elements with no difference in any attributes.
the most interesting and desirable trend for all the techies over there would be, macine learning in testing too. i would say test scenarios optimization will lead to a great impact by identifying the similar scenarios and get to eliminate them. at the same time, all the tester has to have knowledge on devops tools too (jenkins using docker), with this- testers can also build the code into an environmnet. this actually reduces the manpower for a firm. 
i never worked on legacy applications but my approach would be not as same as i do for recent applications. to be precise, as we cant automate everything, at times manual test can be an asset in this case. from automation perspective, i would be asking client the poor qualty areas which are to be automated, the key areas of functionality and obviously the the areas where they have high prone to risks. based on all these i would automate which can be a easier task for both me and client as well.
Well, i place lot many orders from this portal. when i intially opened this website, i was too hungry and in a hurry to order something i like, i have selected the cuisine and the dishes. when the clicked the checkout button, it is a mandatory thing to login or create an account to place an order. when a human is in damn hunger, he just want the food as soon as possible without these formalities. i thought like instead of just asking for an account, it can ask for 'continue as a guest' then it can ask for phone number, email and address while payment. for future reference too, this cruicial information would be fine instead of a mandatary account creation.
